# PhD Thesis on Joint Models for Longitudinal Data with Informative Time Measurements: R Code

This repository contains the R code developed for my PhD thesis on joint models for longitudinal data with informative time measurements.

The code included here corresponds strictly to the parts developed by me:

- `simulation_study_I/` – Code for the first simulation study.
- `em_algorithm/` – Custom implementation of the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm used in the joint model.
- `simulation_study_II/` – Code for the second simulation study.

This repository is intended solely as supplementary material to the thesis.

## Notes

Standard model fitting procedures (e.g. using `gee()` and `lme()`) are described in the thesis but not included here, as they rely on existing functions from public R packages and do not constitute original code developed by me.

## Data Availability

The dataset used in the thesis is not publicly available due to confidentiality constraints.  
As such, scripts requiring access to the original data will not run without it.

## Licence

This code is provided for **academic use only**.  
Any commercial use, redistribution, or modification without explicit permission from the author is not allowed.

No support or additional documentation is provided.
