# Simulation Study II

This folder contains the R code for the second simulation study performed as part of the thesis on joint models for longitudinal data with informative time measurements.

The scripts include code to generate data, run simulations, and analyze results.

## Dependencies

The EM algorithm implementation in the `em-algorithm` folder must be sourced or run prior to running these scripts, as it is required for the simulation study.

## Contents

- `simulation_study_II.R`: Main script for the second simulation study.

## Usage

Source the EM algorithm script first, then run the simulation study script in your R environment to reproduce the results or adapt the code for further experiments.
