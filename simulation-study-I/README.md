# Simulation Study I

This folder contains the R code for the first simulation study performed as part of the thesis on joint models for longitudinal data with informative time measurements.

The scripts include code analysing the behaviour of the two intensity functions under different values of the association parameters, as well as the main simulation study.

## Contents

- `intensity1_behaviour.R`: Code to study the behaviour of the first intensity function for different values of α and β (Appendix A).
- `intensity2_behaviour.R`: Code to study the behaviour of the second intensity function for different values of α and β (Appendix A).
- `simulation_study_I.R`: Main script for Simulation Study I.

## Usage

Run the scripts in your R environment to reproduce the figures and results.
